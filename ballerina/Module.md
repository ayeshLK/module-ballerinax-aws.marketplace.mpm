## Overview

[AWS Marketplace Metering Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplacemetering/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) is 
a usage and billing service that allows AWS Marketplace sellers to report the usage of their products for 
billing purposes. This service supports both software-as-a-service (SaaS) products and metering products sold through 
AWS Marketplace.

The `ballerinax/aws.marketplace.metering` package provides APIs to interact with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service, 
enabling developers to submit usage records, batch meter usage data, and manage metering-related tasks programmatically.

## Setup guide
Before using this connector in your Ballerina application, complete the following:
1. Create an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)

## Quickstart

To use the `aws.marketplace.mpm` connector in your Ballerina project, modify the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ballerinax/aws.marketplace.mpm` module into your Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/aws.marketplace.mpm;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a new `mpm:Client` by providing the access key ID, secret access key, and the region.

```ballerina
configurable string accessKeyId = ?;
configurable string secretAccessKey = ?;

mpm:Client mpm = check new(region = mpm:US_EAST_1, auth = {
    accessKeyId,
    secretAccessKey
});
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

```ballerina
mpm:ResolveCustomerResponse response = check mpm->resolveCustomer("xxxxxx");
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

Use the following command to compile and run the Ballerina program.

```bash
bal run
```
